<p>Objective:<br>
The objective of this project was to restore a broken Sonoray 301 Flaw and Thickness Tester, an older electronic device, to learn about repairing vintage electronics and bring it back to functional use. This project aimed to gain hands-on experience in electronics repair and restoration.</p>
<p>Backstory:<br>
The project began when I was given a broken Sonoray 301 Flaw and Thickness Tester by someone who didn't have time to repair it themselves. Intrigued by the opportunity to work on a vintage electronic device and learn about its inner workings, I enthusiastically accepted the challenge to restore it to working condition.</p>
<p>Components Used:<br>
- Sonoray 301 Flaw and Thickness Tester unit<br>
- Electronic repair tools including soldering iron, multimeter, thermal camera, and oscilloscope<br>
- Replacement components as needed for repairing circuitry and components<br>
- Technical manual booklet for troubleshooting and restoration guidance</p>
<p>This project showcases my interest in vintage electronics and my dedication to learning and mastering electronics repair skills.</p>
<p>Goals:<br>
- Learn Electronics Repair: Gain practical skills in diagnosing, repairing, and restoring vintage electronic equipment.<br>
- Restore Functionality: Bring the Sonoray 301 Flaw and Thickness Tester back to operational use, preserving its historical and technical value.<br>
- Hands-On Experience: Apply theoretical knowledge in electronics to real-world repair challenges and gain insights into older electronic technologies.</p>
