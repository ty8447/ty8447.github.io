<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Objective:</b><br>
The objective of our Major Qualifying Project (MQP) was to design a mechanism that would reduce the forces experienced by ice deformation on fixed docks. This project aimed to provide a practical solution for the winterization of docks, leveraging our engineering knowledge and skills acquired at WPI.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Backstory:</b><br>
Our senior capstone project was initiated after one of my partners became frustrated with the winterization process for fixed docks. Recognizing the need for a better solution, we formed a team and worked with an advisor to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of our design. Our goal was to create a mechanism that would mitigate the deformation caused by ice, improving the durability and longevity of fixed docks.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Components Used:</b><br>
- Mechanical components designed to absorb and distribute ice deformation forces<br>
- Simulation software for modeling and testing the mechanism's performance<br>
- Prototyping materials for building and validating the design<br>
- Patent application for protecting the intellectual property of our innovative solution</p>
<p>This project showcases our ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, working collaboratively to create an innovative and impactful solution.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 18px;">Goals:</b><br>
- Reduce Ice Deformation Forces: The mechanism is designed to minimize the forces exerted by ice on fixed docks, preventing damage and extending the dock's lifespan.<br>
- Practical Application: Aims to provide a cost-effective and easily implementable solution for dock owners facing winterization challenges.<br>
- Innovation and Patenting: Successfully patented the design, demonstrating the novelty and potential impact of our solution.</p>
