<p>Objective:<br>
My objective was to design and build a custom Onewheel from scratch, using a custom battery and 3D-printed enclosures. This project aimed to create a personalized and cost-effective alternative to commercial Onewheel products, leveraging my skills in engineering and design.</p>
<p>Backstory:<br>
After successfully building an electric longboard, I became interested in exploring other personal electric vehicles. Upon seeing someone riding a Onewheel, I was inspired to create my own instead of purchasing one from the company. This project allowed me to push the boundaries of DIY engineering and create a unique PEV tailored to my preferences.</p>
<p>Components Used:<br>
- Custom battery pack designed for optimal performance and integration<br>
- High-torque electric motor for smooth and powerful propulsion<br>
- Custom 3D-printed enclosures for housing electronics and providing structural integrity<br>
- LFOCer 3 VESC<br>
- Pressure Sensors<br>
- Custom Wire Harness
- Battery Management System</p>
<p>Goals:<br>
- Customization and Performance: The custom Onewheel is designed to meet specific performance criteria and personal preferences, offering a tailored riding experience.<br>
- Cost-Effective Solution: Aims to provide a more affordable alternative to commercial Onewheel products by utilizing custom-built components and DIY techniques.<br>
- Innovation and Engineering: Demonstrates innovative thinking and advanced engineering skills in designing and building a complex PEV from scratch.</p>
<p>Challenges and Solutions:<br>
Throughout the development process, challenges included designing a robust battery pack that fits within the tight constraints of the Onewheel, ensuring reliable balance and control through sensor integration, and fabricating durable and precise 3D-printed enclosures. By iterating on design prototypes and conducting thorough testing, I successfully overcame these challenges to build a functional and reliable custom Onewheel.</p>
<p>Future Improvements:<br>
Looking ahead, I plan to enhance the custom Onewheel by integrating the lightbar that I am designing and a better cable management for a cleaner system. These improvements aim to further refine the riding experience and expand the capabilities of the custom-built Onewheel.</p>
